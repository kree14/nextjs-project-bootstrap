# Detailed Implementation Plan for Web-Based Chess Training Assistant

## 1. New Page Creation
**File:** `src/app/chess-training/page.tsx`  
- Create a new Next.js page that serves as the main entry point for the training assistant.  
- Import and compose the following components: `<ChessBoard />`, `<TrainingControls />`, and `<TrainingLogs />`.  
- Implement responsive layout using modern CSS (grid or flex) to display the board prominently, with control panels adjacent or below.  
- Add error boundaries to catch rendering issues and display a fallback UI message.

## 2. Chess Board Component
**File:** `src/components/chess/ChessBoard.tsx`  
- Build the chessboard using a grid of divs representing 8×8 squares styled with CSS to emulate a clean, minimalist board.  
- Integrate chess logic via the `chess.js` library to maintain board state and validate moves.  
- Implement drag-and-drop move support using native React event handlers and update state using callbacks.  
- Develop an overlay mechanism (using an additional canvas or SVG) to draw color-coded arrows (green for best move, yellow for good move, red for avoid move) and include fallback messages if rendering fails.

## 3. Training Controls Component
**File:** `src/components/chess/TrainingControls.tsx`  
- Create controls for adjusting engine parameters such as ELO strength, skill level, contempt, move overhead, and nodes/time per move using sliders and toggles.  
- Provide checkboxes/toggles for enabling/disabling best move hints and board flip features.  
- Validate input on each control and use state hooks to propagate changes to the chess engine.  
- Style controls with clean typography, ample spacing, and modern color accents without external icons or images.

## 4. Training Logs Component
**File:** `src/components/chess/TrainingLogs.tsx`  
- Develop a collapsible panel showing a real-time log of moves, blunders, warnings, and simple textual evaluations (e.g., “Hangs a pawn”, “Fork threat”).  
- Format log entries with timestamps and brief descriptions; fall back gracefully when no logs are available.  
- Ensure UI updates are smooth and consistent with the overall design.

## 5. Stockfish Engine Integration
**File:** `src/lib/chessEngine.ts`  
- Integrate the Stockfish.js engine by loading it as a WebAssembly module or web worker.  
- Create functions to initialize the engine, send commands (setting parameters for ELO, skill, contempt, etc.), and parse responses.  
- Implement artificial delays and slight inaccuracies; for instance, occasionally override the top move suggestion based on configured ELO thresholds.  
- Add error handling when communicating with the engine (timeouts, unresponsive states) and log errors to the console.

## 6. Chess Utilities
**File:** `src/lib/chessUtils.ts`  
- Implement utility functions for processing PGN/FEN strings using the `chess.js` library.  
- Include functions to load, parse, and export game states; throw appropriate errors for incorrect formats.

## 7. Package and Configuration Updates
**File:** `package.json`  
- Add new dependencies: `"chess.js"` for game logic and `"stockfish.js"` for engine integration.  
- Run `npm install` to update the `package-lock.json`.  
- Optionally update `globals.css` (or create a new CSS module) for any board-specific styling ensuring responsiveness and modern aesthetics.

## 8. Integration & State Management
- Use React state hooks (and possibly Context or useReducer) in `page.tsx` to manage the game state, engine parameters, and UI toggles.  
- Employ `useEffect` to trigger engine evaluations after each move with natural delays to simulate human-like responses.  
- Ensure that the board flip is applied conditionally using CSS transforms based on the user’s toggle or turn logic.

## Summary
- A new Next.js page (`chess-training/page.tsx`) integrates a chess board, controls, and logs for an interactive training assistant.  
- The `ChessBoard.tsx` component provides a stylized grid-based board with drag-and-drop move and arrow overlays for hints.  
- The `TrainingControls.tsx` component offers modern UI sliders and toggles for ELO and engine parameters with validation.  
- The `TrainingLogs.tsx` component displays a real-time log of moves and evaluations with graceful fallbacks.  
- The `chessEngine.ts` module encapsulates Stockfish.js integration including error handling and parameter settings.  
- The `chessUtils.ts` file handles PGN/FEN processing using `chess.js`.  
- Dependencies such as `chess.js` and `stockfish.js` are added to `package.json`.  
- State management and integration in `page.tsx` ensure a synchronized, modern web-based chess training experience.
